//! Per-record translations for the seeded property dataset.
//!
//! The dataset in [`store`](crate::store) is authored per building, not chrome:
//! project names, developers, terms, reasoning. Names and developers are proper
//! nouns and stay as written. The two prose fields — `terms` and
//! `additional_reasoning` — are what a reader actually reads, and they live
//! here, in a sidecar keyed by the building's (stable) UUID.
//!
//! ## Why a sidecar and not the catalogue
//!
//! `messages/*/common.json` is this surface's *chrome*. A property's terms are
//! content: they are edited per building, they arrive from the seed rather than
//! from a designer, and there are as many of them as there are buildings. Mixing
//! the two would mean a catalogue that grows with the portfolio. This is the
//! same shape the conductor uses for publication cards.
//!
//! ## Provenance, per field
//!
//! Each entry stores the English it was translated from. A field whose English
//! has since moved is refused and the current English renders instead — a
//! translation of a sentence nobody writes any more is worse than the sentence.
//! Per *field*, because `terms` and `reasoning` are edited independently.
