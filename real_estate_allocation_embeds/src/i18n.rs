//! Locale wiring for the embed bundle.
//!
//! Loading and policy come from [`real_estate_allocation_core::i18n`], shared
//! with the dashboard. The catalogue does not: this surface's copy is marketing
//! and the dashboard's is operational, and one vocabulary cannot serve both
//! audiences.
//!
//! **Only the labels are translated.** The section intro, the two property names
//! and the TMS street address in [`view`](crate::view) stay as written — they are
//! authored copy and proper nouns, the same class as the dataset in the
//! dashboard's `store`. A translated frame around English prose is the worse of
//! the two failures.
//!
//! `messages/en/common.json` is **generated** — `cargo run --example
//! dump_messages` — because English is authored at the `t!` sites in `view.rs`.
//! The other four are hand-authored in the `{en, t}` envelope.
