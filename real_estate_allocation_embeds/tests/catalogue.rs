//! The Rust half of `evinvest-i18n-check`: the committed English catalogue must
//! still match the code, and no translation may have drifted from its source.
//!
//! `view` is pulled in by `#[path]` rather than through the crate because
//! `src/lib.rs` is `#![cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")]` — and because `t!`
//! registration is a linker fact, so the sites have to be linked into *this*
//! binary to be seen. Nothing is rendered here; that is the point.
